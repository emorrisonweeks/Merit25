    <h2 class="statementh2">Hi, my name is Emily Morrison Weeks</h2>
     <p>My art and design background is multidisciplinary, beginning with illustration, painting, metalsmithing, and ceramics. 
        During my undergraduate coursework, my relationship with design branched out into the theatre, designing 
        costumes, makeup, sets, and props. After earning my bachelor's degree in theatre with a minor in psychology, I spent time designing curriculum and teaching those theatrical design topics to teens through children's theatre companies as well as UW Madison College For Kids, a PreCollege program through the university. I have also worked as both a makeup and costume designer for theatre, opera, and film. Eventually, I found that designing posters for theatre and film 
        companies connected my passion for the performing arts with my interest in graphic art and design, providing a full-circle feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        This lead me to MCAD’s MAGWD program, where I have fallen in love with typography and branding and rekindled my love of illustration 
        (earning a CE certificate in illustration from MCAD along the way). Currently, I'm delighting in  discovering the intersection of psychology 
        and design through my UX coursework. I believe that the marriage of graphic and web design can help me grow into a versatile designer and help 
        open doors to numerous professional opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I continue to progress in the MAGWD program I can envision multiple possible career paths for myself, either in graphic or UX design. Through my design work moving 
        forward, I hope to connect my artistic roots with the exciting possibilities technology offers, creating graphic and web design solutions that feel
        personal and work to connect people with each other in meaningful ways. 
    </p>
