    <img src="../Images/curiostyle.png" alt="style guide for magazine" class="responsive">
    <p>
        I named my magazine Curio, as it was intented to feature a curated collection
        of curious works of art.
    </p>
    <p>
        The color palette I decided to use for this issue allowed me to create
        something soft and dreamy feeling with dark undertones. This supported the
        artwork featured in the magazine, along with the overall feeling I was aiming
        to evoke with the magazine’s design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I experimented with several fonts before finally choosing Fat Frank Heavy. Its
        bold weight and absence of serifs create a cool, modern feeling. I especially
        liked the shape of the aperture of the C. Even from a distance, the masthead
        is highly legible in this font, which helps with accessibility.
    </p>
  <div class="outcome">
        <h2 class="curioh2">OUTCOME | COVER AND FEATURE ARTICLE</h2>
        <img src="../Images/curiocover.png" alt="a magazine cover with a painting of a kitschy vintage space girl with pink hair and a robot" class="responsive">
        <p>
            I ended up choosing a piece by painter Chris Guest for the cover, because I
            enjoyed the way it combined a 1960’s vintage aesthetic with a contemporary
            alternative feeling. Because of the bright colors and blending of quirky vintage
            and modern aesthetics, I could imagine it attracting the audience I was seeking
            with Curio.

            The negative space in this painting provided wonderful opportunities for masthead
            and callout line placement. Overlapping the masthead with the helmet a
            bit and placing the callout lines in ways that mimicked the bolts coming out of
            the robot helped the type connect with the image in a playful way befitting of
            the magazine’s style.

         <p>
            For my feature article, I created two spreads featuring artwork from Milwaukee WI
            based artist, Katie Gamb.
         </p>
        <p>
            I enjoyed choosing colors which played well with the color schemes used in her
            paintings to create a feeling of wonder and wistfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The display font chosen for the feature article, Barricada Pro, was chosen because
            its thickness and curves give it a playful, feminine feeling, supporting the themes in
            the featured artwork. I chose to make the display font large and verticle, incorporating
            the type as part of the imagery.
