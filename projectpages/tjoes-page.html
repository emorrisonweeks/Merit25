        <p><strong class="tjoesbold">WHAT:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A case study and redesign of the Trader Joe’s website for a new, unexpected
            audience
        </p>
        <p><strong class="tjoesbold">WHY:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning how to analyze an existing website and its target audience, identifying
            strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats as well as how to design and prototype
            a website with a new and different audience in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            When considering the accessibility of a grocery store today, considerations can and
            ought to venture beyond the physical aspects of the store. The website needs to be set
            up in a way that is easy for users to read, comprehend, and navigate, but accessibility
            features can go beyond that as well. In a world full of delivery subscription box services
            and Instacart almost anything can be ordered online and delivered to a user’s front
            door. Trader Joe’s, however, remains an exception. This project explores a user’s navigation
            through the Trader Joe’s website, examining how visual information, color, and
            layout can influence one’s ability to find and acquire what they need as they attempt to
            browse recipes and add items to their cart. This project also imagines and explores
            how the addition of online orders could make a difference in terms of accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            This case study was conducted through competitor research, user persona development,
            SWOT analysis, user flow sketching, the creation of mobile, desktop, and tablet
            wireframes as well as prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The audience being considered for this project includes individuals who might normally
            fall under the Trader Joe’s target audience but are unable to visit the brick and mortar
            store. This includes individuals living in areas where Trader Joe’s doesn’t have stores,
            such as small towns and rural areas, individuals who are unable to shop in person due
            to disabilities, physical or mental health concerns, as well as individuals without the time
            affluence necessary to accommodate in-person shopping trips. This audience is meant to include 
            individuals who have different sensory needs due to neurodivergence or anxiety who may become 
            overstimulated by the lighting and busy environment of the store. This is reflected in the 
            considerations I took when evaluating the amount of visual input to include as well as what type of 
            color palette to use in my redesign. Everyone included in this audience would benefit from access to 
            affordable, healthy food and would need to order Trader Joe’s products for delivery or pickup. For more information, please feel free to explore the full case study in Figma below:

    <p>
        After conducting research to determine the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses,
        and threats as well as evaluating the existing user persona, new user personas
        were created to represent the unexpected audience the Trader Joe’s Website
        would be redesigned for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once research had been done and new user personas had been created, wireframes
        were created for mobile, tablet, and desktop designs.
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating the wireframes, I was ready to get to work prototyping in
        Figma.
    </p>

    <!--OUTCOME SECTION-->
  <div class="outcome">
        <h2 class="tjoesh2">OUTCOME | SOLUTIONS AND PROTOTYPES</h2>
        <img src="../Images/tjoesmobile.png" alt="a woman's hand holding a mobile phone with the Trader Joe's App open on it">
    
        <p>
            Buttons were created to be large, appealing looking, and accessible. Navigational
            choices and buttons have been limited to the minimum necessary on each page
            to avoid overwhelm or decision fatigue. The user flow has been designed with
            the same intentions, guiding the user through options that match their needs
            clearly and concisely while also being aesthetically pleasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve the obstacle of the unexpected audience not being able to access the
            store in person, three new features were introduced : weekly meal kit subscriptions,
            the ability to order groceries for delivery, and the ability to order groceries
            for pickup. If users do not wish to subscribe for weekly meal kits but do
            want to give a featured meal kit recipe a try, they are able to click a button to
            add meal kit ingredients to their grocery order without subscribing. This solves
            the issue Trader Joe’s currently has with products in the recipes not being linked
            to the products on the website. The “add to shopping list” feature from the existing
            Trader Joe’s website has been replaced with the option to add items to a
            cart and actually check out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Product imagery is used to support text and help users to identify items, while
            simultaneously adding to the visual representation of the brand. A hero banner
            was added to the home page featuring clear photography of various products
            with the Trader Joe’s logo over it. This imagery helps users associate their online
            experience with the feeling of picking out groceries, specifically at Trader Joe’s.
            This banner, paired with the simple home page layout and friendly, calming color
            palette, is intended to help users into the right headspace for grocery shopping.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve the obstacle of visual clutter and overwhelm, the number of images
            on the website was scaled back. This way, each time an image is featured on the
            site, it has a specific purpose. For example, the quirky black and white illustrations
            were repurposed to draw attention to special announcements or important
            user decision points. The black and white illustrations work to support the
            text rather than pulling focus or creating confusion.
        </p>
