        <p><strong class="havenbold">WHAT:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Environmental design for a fictional restaurant
        </p>
        <p><strong class="havenbold">WHY:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To explore typographic design through the lens of a physical environment
            and branded assets
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/book-bar-mood.png" alt="images of jewel toned cafes and book store environments with food, cocktails, and coffee">
        </p>
        <p>In Typography class, I was able to work on an environmental design project which
            tasked me with creating the branding, signage, and additional assets for a fictional
            restaurant.
        </p>
        <p> I took my inspiration from a book bar in Madison, WI called Leopold’s Cafe. From
             there, I deepened my research, looking at the branding and business models of
            other book bars in cities such as New York and Minneapolis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I loved the idea of creating a space where introverts and extroverts alike could
            find a cozy reading nook or meet up with friends. My restaurant would serve
            brunch and espresso beverages earlier in the day, moving to cocktails and other
            food in the evenings. There would be a small performance space for live acoustic
            music, staged readings of plays, and other arts and literature focused events.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided on a jewel toned, cozy color palette inspired by vintage book covers
            and ambient low lit spaces. I wanted the restaurant to have a hidden gem vibe -
            something that feels cool and alluring yet well worn and comfortable.
        </p>
    </div>

<!--PROCESS SECTION-->
  <div class="process">
    <h2 class="havenh2">PROCESS | LOGO</h2>
    <img src="../Images/havenprocess.png" alt="logo sketches for haven">
    <p>After conducting my research, I sketched out several iterations of possible logos with
        possible names for the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose the name Haven for my restaurant, as it describes the environment within.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The font I chose to use is A Day Without Sun. Because of its thin yet varied stroke
        weight and slightly rounded terminals, it had a hand-written quality to it that paired
        well with the vector drawing of an open book I created for the V in the center. It is
        also quite legible in various colors and sizes, which is important for accessiblility and
        versitility.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ended up designing two versions of the Haven logo. The circular logo is meant to be
        reminiscent of both the sun and moon, as either could be in the sky while customers
        enjoy a book, beverage, or event. The sparkles in the circular logo are meant to add
        a little bit of whimsy while also reminding customers of the stars, reinforcing the idea
        that this is also an evening establishment. It is colorful and eye catching in a way that
        makes it ideal for glass window signage. The second logo is versitile and excellent on
        black and white signage or on the cover of the menu.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--OUTCOME SECTION-->
  <div class="outcome">
        <h2 class="havenh2">OUTCOME | SIGNAGE</h2>
        <img src="../Images/finalhavenoutdoorchalkboard.png" alt="outdoor chalk board signage for haven">
        <img src="../Images/finalhavenstreetsign.png" alt="outdoorsignage for haven">
        <img src="../Images/glasssignwithchairs.png" alt="glass signage">
        <img src="../Images/havenfinalindoorchalkboard.png" alt="indoor chalk board signage for haven">
        <p>
            Hanging street signage, outdoor and indoor chalkboard signage, and
            glass window signage were created.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simpler version of the logo worked well in black and white, which
            made it a natural choice for chalk boards and the black and white
            hanging sign. The more colorful logo worked well as a window sign.
        </p>
        <h2 class="havenh2">OUTCOME | MENU AND ASSETS</h2>
        <img src="../Images/finalhavenbookmenuwoman.png" alt="woman holds menu designed to look like vintage book">

        <p>
            The menu design calls upon the themes of arts and literature. Repurposed vintage
            books have the pages removed and replaced with menu pages. The covers of the
            books are embossed with the Haven logo.
        </p>
        <div class="menus">
        <img src="../Images/Haven-Brunch-Menu-1.png" alt="brunch menu for haven">
        <img src="../Images/Haven-Evening-Food-Menu-1.png" alt="dinner menu for haven">
        <img src="../Images/Haven-Drink-Menu-1.png" alt="drink menu for haven">
        </div>
        <p>
            The inner pages of the menu feature a watercolor border, a callback to the arts
            and literature heart of the restaurant. Over the watercolor are some gold flecks to
            tie it together with the gilded cover.
        </p>

        <img src="../Images/havencofffee.png" alt="a bag of whole bean coffee with yellow Haven logo on it">
        <p>
            As a special asset, I designed packaging for bags of Haven branded whole bean coffee. These reading-themed blends would be sold in the book bar. 
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/havenad.png" alt="a to go coffee cup with a circular haven logo on the side against a yellow background">
        <p>
            As an additional asset, I created an ad for Haven which could be seen in print or digital form.
